 <li>The submission time is determined not when the commit is made but when the git push is made.</li>

<ol>

 <li>Write down a Python program to visualize ZXZ Euler angles.</li>

 <li>This is how ZXZ Euler angles works

  <ol>

   <li>Rotate along Z-axis by α ii. Rotate along X-axis of the new frame by β iii.   Rotate along Z-axis of the new frame by γ</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Start from 9-Orientation&amp;Rotation practice code, implement ZXZ Euler angles and add code to change α, β, γ values in the following way.

  <ol>

   <li>If you press or repeat a key, the value of α, β, γ should be changed as shown in the table:</li>

 <li>Hint: You do not need to store a composed rotation matrix as a global variable. You can just store α, β, γ as global variables.</li>

 <li>Set the window title to <strong>your student ID</strong> and the window size to (480,480).</li>

 <li>Expected result: Uploaded LabAssignment9-1.mp4</li>

 <li>Files to submit: A Python source file (Name the file whatever you want (in English). Extension should be .py)</li>
